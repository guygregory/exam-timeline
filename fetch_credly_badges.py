"""
Script to fetch Credly digital badges from a public profile and extract badge information.

Usage:
    python fetch_credly_badges.py <username> [--output <output.csv>]

Example:
    python fetch_credly_badges.py guygregory --output credly_badges.csv

If no output filename is provided, the script writes to credly_badges_<username>.csv.

The script makes a GET request to the Credly API endpoint:
https://www.credly.com/users/<username>/badges.json

The API returns JSON containing a `data` array with badge details. The script
writes a CSV file containing the badge name, issuer, and the date issued.

Note: Internet access is required for this script to work. The API endpoint is
unauthenticated for public profiles.

To test locally, you can start a local web server `python -m http.server 8000` and then open using `http://localhost:8000`.
